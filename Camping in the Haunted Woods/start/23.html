<p>You flee into the forest, 
running as fast as you can. You don’t know where you are going and fall often,
 tripping on the roots of trees and large stones. Branches hit your arms and face but you can’t stop,
 too afraid of what is behind you. Suddenly there is a noice, like the growling of a large beast. 
 You stop running and see evil yellow eyes in the darkness. Before you can blink you are surrounded.
 Shadows move on all sides. They close in, attacking, tearing you limb from limb.

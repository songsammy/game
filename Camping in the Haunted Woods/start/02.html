<body><h1>The End</h1>
<p>
You decide to stay at school and plan on spending the weekend studying. Instead you lie on your bed in your dorm room all weekend, playing on your phone. Monday arrives and you feel tired. You haven't finished your homework for Mr. McGeady's class, you have a fight with your best friend and you slip over on ice and hurt your knee. Welcome to a new week. 
<br />Goodbye.

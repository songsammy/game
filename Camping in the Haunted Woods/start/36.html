You put your shoulder to the door and it thankfully opens. You discover the inside is much better than the outside. There is a bathroom with a shower. Out the back there is even a spa-pool ready to be used. Unfortunately there is no food. The sun is going down so you have to spend another night in the woods but thankfully the cabin is warm and comfortable.

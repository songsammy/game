<p>You keep walking. You are tired and hungry but thankfully are able to find a path. After several more hours of walking the path splits in two directions. You have to decide which way to go, to the left, to the right or make your own path and walk straight ahead. Which way will you go?

<a href="42.html">Choice Two: Straight ahead</a><br><br>
<a href="47.html">Choice Three: To the right</a><br><br>
